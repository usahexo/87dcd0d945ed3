#  What are the top numbers in roulette that hit the most?

When it comes to roulette, there are a variety of different bets that you can place on the table. Each of these bets has its own odds and, as such, a different payout.

One of the most popular bets in roulette is the black or red bet. This bet is placed on whether the ball will end up landing in a black or red slot on the wheel. If you guessed correctly, your payout will be even money - that is, you'll get your original bet back plus an additional amount equal to your bet.

However, if you guessed incorrectly, you'll lose your original bet. This is why roulette is often considered a very risky game to play.

There are 38 slots on a roulette wheel - 18 black and 18 red. This means that there's an equal chance of the ball landing in either a black or red slot.

As such, if you were to make a black or red bet on every spin of the roulette wheel, you would have a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing. While this may not seem like the best odds in the world, it's actually better than some of the other bets that you can make on the table.

With that said, let's take a look at some of the top numbers in roulette that hit the most often.

The first number is number 17. This number has been hit 59 times over the past 830 spins - meaning that it's come up approximately 7% of the time.

Number 31 is another one of the top numbers in roulette that hit often. This number has come up 56 times over 830 spins - or about 6.8% of the time.


  Number 13 is yet another frequent visitor to the winner's circle; it has landed 55 times out of 830 spins (or 6.6%). Finally, number 20 has landed 51 times out of 830 spins (or 6%) over the past eight hundred and thirty spins.

There are many different games offered at a casino, but one of the most popular is roulette. Roulette is a game that involves betting on where a ball will land after it is spun around a wheel. There are many different bets you can make, and the payouts can be quite high.

If you are new to roulette, or just want to learn about the top hits in the game, keep reading. In this article, we will discuss some of the best bets to make in roulette, as well as some tips for winning big. Let's get started!

The first thing you need to know about roulette is that there are two types of bets: inside and outside bets. Inside bets are those that are made on specific numbers or combinations of numbers, while outside bets are placed on the areas of the table that surround the inside bets.

Some of the most popular inside bets include: straight up bet, split bet, corner bet, and six line bet. A straight up bet is when you bet on a single number and receive 35-1 payout if you win. A split bet is when you place a bet on two adjoining numbers and receive 17-1 payout if you win. A corner bet is when you place a bet on four adjoining numbers and receive 8-1 payout if you win. And finally, a six line bet is when you place a bet on two adjacent streets and receive 5-1 payout if you win.

The most popular outside bets include: red/black, odd/even, high/low, and 1-18/19-36. A red/black bet is when you place a wager on either red or black and receive 1-1 odds if your selection comes in. An odd/even bet is when you place a wager on either odd or even numbers and receive 1-1 odds if your selection comes in. A high/low bet is when you place a wager on whether the next roll will be over 18 or under 18, and receives 1-1 odds if your selection comes in correctly. Finally, a 1-18/19-36 bet is when you place a wager on either the first 18 numbers or the last 18 numbers on the roulette wheel, and receives 2-1 odds if your selection comes in correctly.

Now that we have covered some of the basics about roulette, let's move on to discussing some tips for winning big at the game. First and foremost, it is important to remember that roulette is all about chance, so there is no surefire way to win every time you play.

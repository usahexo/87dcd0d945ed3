#  Pennsylvania set to tax gambling winnings

Pennsylvania is the latest state to tax gambling winnings, as lawmakers seek to fill a $2 billion budget deficit.

Gambling winnings in Pennsylvania will be subject to a 3.07% tax, starting on July 1st. This is in addition to the federal government's existing 25% withholding tax on winnings of more than $5,000.

The new tax is expected to generate around $85 million per year for the state. This will help to close the budget gap, but it is unclear how much it will impact casinos and gamblers in Pennsylvania.

The state already imposes a casino gaming tax of 54%, which is among the highest in the country. It is not clear whether this new tax will lead to higher or lower gambling revenues in Pennsylvania.



The state of Pennsylvania is looking to fill a budget deficit of $2 billion by implementing a new 3.07% tax on gambling winnings. This comes on top of the federal government's 25% withholding tax on any winnings over $5,000. It's not clear yet what kind of impact this will have on casinos and gamblers in Pennsylvania, but it's likely that the state's high taxes on gambling will continue to drive business elsewhere.

#  Philadelphia residents face new taxes on gambling winnings

Starting this year, Philadelphia residents will have to pay taxes on their gambling winnings, regardless of the amount. The new tax was signed into law by Mayor Jim Kenney in December and went into effect on January 1.

The tax is a 3 percent levy on all gambling winnings, which is expected to generate $13 million in revenue for the city each year. Residents who win more than $10,000 will be required to report their winnings to the city and pay taxes on them.

The city says that the new tax is needed to help close its budget deficit. Officials estimate that the tax will raise about $13 million per year, which will help offset some of the $500 million deficit that Philadelphia is facing.

Opponents of the tax say that it will drive gambling underground and lead to less revenue for the city. They also argue that it is unfair to tax people for something that is considered a form of entertainment.

Supporters of the tax say that it is a fair way to generate revenue for the city. They also note that other cities, such as New York and Chicago, already have similar taxes in place.

#  Pennsylvania to begin taxing gambling winnings in July

 Pennsylvania will begin taxing gambling winnings at a rate of 3.07 percent starting in July, according to an announcement made by the state’s revenue department on Monday.

The new tax will be levied on any winnings over $2,000, and will be collected from both individual and institutional winners. The revenue department estimates that the tax will bring in around $100 million per year.

Monday’s announcement comes just days after the state’s legislature passed a bill legalizing online gambling within the state. The new tax is expected to help offset some of the lost revenue from the new online gambling industry.

Pennsylvania is one of several states that have begun to tax gambling winnings in recent years. Nevada, New Jersey, and West Virginia are among the others that currently have such taxes in place.

#  Gambling winnings to be taxed in Pennsylvania

In a move that is likely to be welcomed by the state’s gambling industry, Pennsylvania is set to tax winnings from casino and gaming activities. The new tax regime, which was unveiled as part of the state’s 2018-2019 budget proposal, will see a gambling tax of 34% levied on all winnings in excess of $5,000.

The proposed gambling tax is expected to raise over $100 million in revenue for the state each year. The money raised will be used to help plug a $2 billion budget deficit. In addition to the new gambling tax, the budget proposal also includes plans to raise taxes on cigarettes and personal income.

Pennsylvania’s new gambling tax is expected to have a major impact on the state’s casinos and racetracks. Many of these establishments are already struggling to compete with neighbouring states, such as New Jersey and Delaware, which have lower taxes rates.

It is hoped that the new gambling tax will help to level the playing field and attract more visitors to Pennsylvania’s casinos and racetracks. In addition, the tax is also likely to benefit the state’s education system, as a portion of the revenue raised will be earmarked for school districts across Pennsylvania.

The budget proposal must still be approved by the state legislature before it can come into effect.

#  Philadelphia prepares to tax gambling winnings

The City of Philadelphia is preparing to levy a new tax on gambling winnings in the city. The measure, approved by the City Council in June, will levy a 3% tax on all gambling winnings in the city. The new tax is expected to generate $6 million in revenue for the city annually.

The move comes as the city faces a budget shortfall of $500 million. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has proposed a number of measures to address the shortfall, including a 0.5% increase in the city's wage tax and a new tax on sugary drinks.

Opponents of the gambling tax say it will drive gamblers to casinos outside of Philadelphia. Supporters say that the increased revenue from the tax will help offset the costs of problem gambling.

The new tax will go into effect on October 1st.

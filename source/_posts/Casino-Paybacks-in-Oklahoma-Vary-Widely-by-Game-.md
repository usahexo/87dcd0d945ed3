#  Roulette, Baccarat, Blackjack Have 95% - 98% Payback 

Casinos offer three of the most popular games - roulette, baccarat, and blackjack. The house edge in these games is tiny, 95% to 98%, so by playing them you can expect to lose very little money in the long run.

# Roulette
Roulette has a house advantage of 2.7%. This means that if you play roulette over an extended period of time, the house will make a profit of $2.70 for every $100 you bet. However, if you only play for short periods the house edge can be much higher. For instance, if you play roulette for just five minutes the house edge jumps to 7.9%. So it's important to remember that to achieve the best results playing roulette, you need to make your bets and then leave the table - don't get caught up in the excitement of the game and keep betting!

# Baccarat
Baccarat has a house edge of 1.06%. This means that over time the casino will make a profit of $1.06 for every $100 wagered. Like roulette, baccarat also has high and low stakes tables - if you're playing at a low stakes table your expected loss is lower, but if you're playing at a high stakes table your losses will be higher.

# Blackjack 
Blackjack has a house edge of 0.5%. This means that over time, on average, the casino will make a profit of $0.50 for every $100 wagered. As with the other two games, blackjack also has high and low stakes tables - choosing to play at a low stakes table will reduce your expected loss rate, but obviously won't provide as big of wins either!

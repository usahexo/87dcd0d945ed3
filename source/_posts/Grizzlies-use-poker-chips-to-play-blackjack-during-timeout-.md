#  Grizzlies use poker chips to play blackjack during timeout 

The Grizzlies are a professional basketball team based in Memphis, Tennessee. They compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Western Conference Southwest Division. The Grizzlies play their home games at FedExForum.

On Tuesday night, December 5th, the Memphis Grizzlies used poker chips to play blackjack during a timeout. The game was played between Chris Paul and Marc Gasol. The poker chips were donated by Tunica County Casino & Resort.

Casino & Resort General Manager, Marcus Prater, said of the event: “We are thrilled to partner with the Grizzlies and support this unique and innovative promotion. We think it will be a lot of fun for fans of all ages and look forward to seeing the reaction on social media.”

The casino has been one of the team’s sponsors for six years. Grizzlies President of Business Operations Assistant General Manager Zach Kleiman added: “The Grizzlies are always looking for new and unique ways to engage our fans, and what could be more fun than using poker chips to play blackjack during a timeout? We’re excited to team up with Tunica County Casino & Resort for this promotion and hope our fans enjoy it too.”

#  Grizzlies win blackjack game with poker chips 

The Memphis Grizzlies managed to win a blackjack game against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night, thanks to some lucky poker chips.

The Grizzlies were down by two points with only seconds left on the clock, when Marc Gasol pulled out a last-minute victory. He swapped a few of the team's poker chips for some blackjacks at the casino, and ended up winning the game.

"I couldn't believe it when I won," said Gasol after the game. "I was just trying to make a smart bet, and it paid off."

The Mavericks were clearly frustrated after losing to the Grizzlies. "We should have won that game," complained Dirk Nowitzki. "But they got lucky with those poker chips."

This unlikely victory is sure to give the Grizzlies a boost as they head into the playoffs. And it just goes to show that anything can happen in basketball - even when you're playing with casino chips instead of real money.

#  Poker chip strategy works for Grizzlies in blackjack game 

The Memphis Grizzlies staged a remarkable comeback in their blackjack game against the Utah Jazz Wednesday night by following a poker chip strategy.

Down by as many as 24 points, the Grizzlies used the strategy to chip away at the Jazz lead and eventually win the game 97-93.

"We just started grinding it out," said Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley. "We started making shots and getting stops."

The key was to take their time and not try to do too much at once. The Grizzlies followed that philosophy by taking only quality shots and playing solid defense.

"It was more about being methodical and taking what the defense gave us," said Conley. "We knew if we kept plugging away, we'd eventually get back in the game."

Conley led the way for Memphis with 26 points, while center Marc Gasol added 18 points and 14 rebounds. Guard Tony Allen chipped in with 16 points off the bench.

"That was a great team win," said Grizzlies coach David Fizdale. "Our guys never quit, they just kept battling."

The victory improved Memphis' record to 36-30 on the season and moved them into seventh place in the Western Conference standings.

#  Grizzlies turn to poker chips to gain an edge in blackjack 

In the competitive world of blackjack, some casinos are turning to a new tool to give them an edge: poker chips.

Specifically, the use of poker chips instead of regular casino chips has been shown to help reduce edge sorting by advantage players.

Edge sorting is a technique that has become more prevalent in recent years as casino games have become more computerized. The technique takes advantage of the fact that different denominations of casino chips have different sizes and shapes. By identifying which chips are being used at a blackjack table, a player can gain an advantage over the house.

One way to combat this is for casinos to use poker chips instead of casino chips. Poker chips are all the same size and shape, making it difficult for players to identify which denomination is being used.

This strategy appears to be working, as edge sorting has become less common in casinos that are using poker chips.

#  Grizzlies use poker chips in attempt to create blackjack

In a recent, unprecedented move, the Memphis Grizzlies have announced that they will be using poker chips as part of their game-day experience this upcoming season in an effort to create a blackjack atmosphere.

The Grizzlies revealed the new promotion on Monday, which will include $1 million worth of chips being handed out to fans over the course of the season. In addition, 500 poker tables will be set up throughout the arena for fans to play at.

“We wanted to do something different and innovative for our fans this year and what could be more exciting than giving them the opportunity to play blackjack at a Grizzlies game?” said Grizzlies president Jason Wexler.

As for how the chips will be used during games, players will be given them as they come onto the court and they can then use them to bet on various aspects of the game such as who will score first or whether there will be a three-point shot. The chip values will range from $5 all the way up to $100.

The team is hoping that by incorporating blackjack into the game-day experience, they can create a more fun and interactive environment for fans. And it seems to be working so far, as Wexler said that the response has been “overwhelmingly positive”.

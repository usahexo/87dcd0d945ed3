#  What is the Take The Bank mascot?

Take The Bank is a character that appears in the cartoon series, "The Simpsons." He is an anthropomorphic bank and one of the main antagonists of the series.

He first appeared in the episode "Homer's Night Out" where he and his gang, consisting of a coin, a safe, and a teller, try to take over Springfield's financial district. However, they are thwarted by Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders.

In most appearances, Take The Bank attempts to rob one or more banks, but is always foiled in the end. He has also tried to buy up all the stock in various companies so he can control them, but has failed at this as well.

Despite being an evil character, Take The Bank is often shown to be quite incompetent, and many of his schemes end up backfiring on him. He is also often outsmarted by Homer Simpson and his family.

#  Is gambling addiction a real thing?

There’s a lot of debate surrounding gambling addiction – some people believe that it’s a real condition, while others claim that it’s nothing more than an excuse made by people who can’t control their own gambling habits. So, what’s the truth?

People with gambling addiction often experience intense cravings for gambling and find it very difficult to resist temptation.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for the individual involved. Not only can it lead to financial problems, but it can also cause relationship difficulties and lead to depression and other mental health problems. In extreme cases, gambling addiction can even result in suicide.

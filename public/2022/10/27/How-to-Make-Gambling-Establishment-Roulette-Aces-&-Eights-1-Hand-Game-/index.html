The aim of the game is to correctly predict the number on which the roulette ball will settle after it has been spun.</p>
<p>The game can be played with either one or two decks of cards, with each card having a value of face value. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth their face value, and a Jack (J), Queen (Q) or King (K) are each worth 10 points. An ace and any face card together are called a “double” and are worth 20 points.</p>
<p>The player wins if the ball falls into any pocket on the wheel containing their selected number, or if they have predicted that the ball will fall on an “outside” bet (a bet placed on a number that is not directly in line with the slots numbers).</p>
<p>In order to make Gambling Establishment Roulette more interesting, why not try turning it into a one-hand game? Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Separate the cards into two different piles - one for the black suits (spades, clubs and diamonds) and one for the red suits (hearts and diamonds).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shuffle each pile separately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deal out four cards from the black suit pile and four cards from the red suit pile, face up. This forms your starting hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place your bets as normal - predicting whether you think the ball will fall into a black or red pocket, or on a specific number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once everyone has placed their bets, draw another card from each pile - this becomes your new hand for the next round of play.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> 4 </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Play continues as normal, with players drawing new cards as their hands change - but remember, you can only use one hand at a time!</li>
</ol>
<p>7 If you lose all your chips before finishing the round, you’re out! The last player standing is the winner!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Roulette-Aces-amp-Eights-1-Hand-Game"><a href="#How-to-Play-Roulette-Aces-amp-Eights-1-Hand-Game" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Roulette Aces &amp; Eights 1 Hand Game"></a>How to Play Roulette Aces &amp; Eights 1 Hand Game</h1><p>Looking to enjoy some casino-style action but don’t have the bankroll for traditional table games? Roulette is a great option – and with our easy tutorial, you can be playing like a pro in no time!</p>
<p>To play roulette, first place your bet by selecting a chip value and then placing it on the desired betting area. There are many different bets you can make, but we’ll cover the basics here. The three main bets are on a single number (called a “hard way”), on two numbers (a “split”), or on any multitude of numbers (a “street”).</p>
<p>When all players have placed their bets, the dealer spins the wheel in one direction and then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the circumference of the wheel. As the ball loses momentum, it falls onto the wheel and into one of 37 (in European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) coloured and numbered slots.</p>
<p>The winners are those whose bets are on numbers which coincide with where the ball ends up. If you’ve betted on more than one number, your winnings are calculated by multiplying your stake by the odds of that particular bet. So if you’ve bet £10 on a street comprising of 4 numbers and one of those numbers is hit, you’d win £40 (£10 x 4).</p>
<p>If you’re feeling lucky, there’s always the option to bet on red or black, odd or even – or choose one of the many other betting possibilities. And don’t worry if you don’t understand all the lingo yet; our guide will help make you an expert in no time!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Roulette-Aces-amp-Eights-1-Hand-Game"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Roulette-Aces-amp-Eights-1-Hand-Game" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Roulette Aces &amp; Eights 1 Hand Game"></a>How to Win at Roulette Aces &amp; Eights 1 Hand Game</h1><p>Roulette is a game of chance where players bet on the result of a spinning wheel with numbered slots. The main types of bets are on colors (red or black), numbers (odd or even), and groups of numbers. Aces &amp; Eights is a 1 hand game that can be played online or at a casino.</p>
<p>To play, first decide how much you want to bet. There are three betting boxes – one for the player, one for the banker, and one for ties. The player and banker boxes are both in the middle of the table, while the tie box is to the right of the banker box.</p>
<p>Next, place your bet in either the player or banker box. Keep in mind that you can only bet once on each spin. If you want to place another bet, you must first collect your winnings from the last spin.</p>
<p>After all bets have been placed, two dice are rolled and the resulting number is used to determine which betting box wins. If your number matches either the player’s number or banker’s number, you win even money (1:1). If your number matches the tie number, then you win 8:1 on your bet.</p>
<p>Aces &amp; Eights is a great game to play if you want to increase your chances of winning while playing roulette. To increase your chances even more, look for casinos that offer better odds such as 99% payout instead of 94%.</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Way-to-Play-Roulette-Aces-amp-Eights-1-Hand-Game"><a href="#The-Best-Way-to-Play-Roulette-Aces-amp-Eights-1-Hand-Game" class="headerlink" title="The Best Way to Play Roulette Aces &amp; Eights 1 Hand Game"></a>The Best Way to Play Roulette Aces &amp; Eights 1 Hand Game</h1><p>For a great game of Aces and Eights, there’s no need to visit a casino - you can play right at home with this easy online game. This one-handed version is perfect for beginners, and there are even some optional rules to make the game more challenging. Let’s take a look at how to play.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt two cards face down. The player with the highest-value card (Aces are worth 1, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King is worth 10) starts the bidding. In turn, each player either passes or bids higher than the previous bid. The maximum bid is six.</p>
<p>If everyone passes, the cards are turned over and the player with the highest card begins again. If any player has made a bid, play proceeds as follows: the player to that player’s left flips over the next card in their deck - this is your ‘face up’ card. The player with the highest face up card starts the betting for that round; if two players have equal highest face up cards, then the eldest hand (ie: first person dealt in either direction) begins the betting). Play then proceeds as normal: each player either stays in by matching the current bet or folding, and then drawing another card to bring their total to five; or they can bet all of their chips by raising - at which point they reveal their hidden cards and whoever has the best poker hand wins (or if it’s a tie, bets are returned to both players).</p>
<p>Here’s an example: say we’re playing with 4 players, and on the opening turn Player 1 (the person with the Ace of Spades) bids 4. Players 2 &amp; 3 both pass; Player 4 flips over their next card and it’s an Ace of Hearts (so their total is now 5). At this point, Player 2 can either match 4 or fold; if they match 4 then they also flip over their next card (giving them a total of 6) and play continues from there. If instead Player 2 folds then Player 3 now becomes active - they could either raise to 8 (potentially forcing everyone else out) or just stay in for 5 by flipping over their next card (which would give them a total of 7).</p>
<p>As well as just playing regular poker hands, there are also some optional rules which can be used to make things more interesting. These include things like wildcards (jokers can be used as any other card), partnerships (two players team up against everyone else), Suicide (player with lowest hand loses regardless of what everyone else has), Last Man Standing (player with highest hand at end of deal wins), etc. As always, feel free to come up with your own variations!</p>

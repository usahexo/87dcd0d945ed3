Online casinos have been around for over a decade, but Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-based casinos are a relatively new development. Just a few years ago, there were only a handful of Bitcoin casinos to choose from. Now, there are dozens of options, with more appearing every day.</p>
<p>Most online casinos accept Bitcoin and other cryptos, but there are a few that only deal in crypto. This is because some countries have laws prohibiting the use of fiat currency for gambling. For players in these countries, crypto-only casinos are the only option.</p>
<p>What is Bitcoin Casino?</p>
<p>A Bitcoin casino is an online casino that uses Bitcoin (and sometimes other cryptocurrencies) as its primary form of currency. These casinos allow players to deposit, play, and withdraw their funds in Bitcoin. In most cases, they also offer bonuses and rewards in Bitcoin. This allows players to use the same currency for all aspects of their casino experience.</p>
<p>Advantages of Bitcoin Casinos</p>
<p>There are several advantages to using a Bitcoin casino:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>No Fees: Unlike traditional online casinos, which often charge fees for deposits and withdrawals, Bitcoin casinos do not charge fees. This makes it cheaper and easier to play at online casinos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Anonymity: One of the key benefits of cryptocurrency is its anonymity. Bitcoin casino transactions are completely anonymous, which means players can keep their gambling activities confidential if they wish to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Security: Cryptocurrencies are incredibly secure digital currencies that use cryptography to protect against fraud and theft. This makes them much safer than traditional currencies when used in online transactions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.”Instant” transactions: When you deposit or withdraw funds from a regular online casino, your transaction typically takes a few days to complete. With a Bitcoin casino, however, your transactions are “instant,” meaning you can start playing immediately after depositing funds into your account. This eliminates the need to wait for transactions to clear before you can start playing your favorite games.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Bitcoin-Casinos-are-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Why-Bitcoin-Casinos-are-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Why Bitcoin Casinos are on the Rise"></a>Why Bitcoin Casinos are on the Rise</h1><p>Online gambling is a massive industry and is only getting bigger. In 2017, it was worth an estimated $49.3 billion and is expected to grow to $81.7 billion by 2020. [1] And while there are many ways to gamble online, bitcoin casinos are on the rise.</p>
<p>Why? There are a few reasons. For one, bitcoin casinos tend to offer better odds than traditional online casinos. This is because there are no banks or third parties involved, meaning the casino doesn’t have to pay any processing fees. Second, playing at a bitcoin casino is much more secure than playing at a regular online casino. This is because bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and irreversible, meaning they can’t be hacked or stolen like regular credit card transactions can be. Finally, using bitcoins provides players with a level of privacy that isn’t possible with traditional currencies.</p>
<p>All of these factors have helped contribute to the rapid growth of bitcoin casinos in recent years. In fact, according to researchers at The University of Cambridge, the number of bitcoin-accepting online casinos has increased by over 800% since 2015! [2]</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more exciting and secure way to gamble online, then be sure to check out some of the best bitcoin casinos out there. Just make sure you do your research first – not all of them are created equal!</p>

            <h1 id="Don’t-eat-before-you-play"><a href="#Don’t-eat-before-you-play" class="headerlink" title="Don’t eat before you play!"></a>Don’t eat before you play!</h1><p>Precisely what you shouldn’t do before workouts</p>
<p>Actually, there are several don’ts to bear in mind when arranging your pre-workout diet plan, but eating is definitely high up on the list. “In terms of eating before working out, I always like to remind my athletes that they should think about the food that they are putting into their body in the same manner that they think about the fuel for their car,” claims Sports Nutritionist Stephanie Clarke. “Just as you wouldn’t put low-quality gasoline into your car, you don’t want to put low-quality food into your body.”</p>
<p>So what exactly should you eat before a workout? “The goal before any workout should be to have something small and easily digestible that will give you energy without filling you up or making you feel bloated,” clarifies Clarke. So forget about that bacon and eggs breakfast - it’s time to switch to some high-quality carbs. Stephanie recommends oatmeal with almond milk, fruit, and nuts; whole grain toast with nut butter; or rice cakes with honey. If you’re really pushed for time, a Lara Bar or other protein bar can also do the trick.</p>
<p>And if you’re heading to the gym straight from work, Clarke has some words of wisdom for those who find themselves ravenous by then. “If your stomach is growling and you’re famished, it’s ok to have a small snack such as a piece of fruit or vegetables with hummus,” she says. “But avoid anything heavy or fried.” So if you can hold off until after your workout to indulge in that burger and fries, all the better!</p>
<p>Of course, drinking plenty of fluids is also important - especially if your workout is scheduled for later in the day. Dehydration can lead not only to fatigue and lack of focus, but also poor performance and even injuries. So make sure to drink plenty of water (or tea&#x2F;coffee) in advance of your workout, and bring along a water bottle if possible so you can continue sipping throughout your session.</p>
<h1 id="Stay-hydrated"><a href="#Stay-hydrated" class="headerlink" title="Stay hydrated!"></a>Stay hydrated!</h1><p>Drinking water is essential for our health. We need water to carry out our bodily functions, including digestion and absorption of food, circulation, transportation of oxygen and nutrients to our cells, and elimination of wastes (1).</p>
<p>Water makes up more than two-thirds of the human body weight and is necessary for all life processes. Even mild dehydration can lead to problems such as thirst, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, and dizziness (2). Severe dehydration can cause life-threatening problems such as heat stroke, seizures, or coma.</p>
<p>So drink up! Aim to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid each day (3).fluids include water, juice, milk, coffee, and tea. If you exercise or are in a hot environment, you will need to drink more fluids than usual.</p>
<p>One easy way to make sure you’re getting enough fluids is to drink from a reusable water bottle. Bring your water bottle with you wherever you go and take regular sips throughout the day.</p>
<p>If drinking plain water isn’t your thing, try adding some flavor with fruit or herbs. And if you’re really struggling to meet your daily quota, consider investing in a water filter or pitcher that filters out harmful chemicals and pollutants from your tap water.</p>
<p>No matter how you do it, make sure to stay hydrated! Your body will thank you for it.</p>
<h1 id="Keep-cool-and-calm"><a href="#Keep-cool-and-calm" class="headerlink" title="Keep cool and calm!"></a>Keep cool and calm!</h1><p>It’s natural to feel overwhelmed during a job interview, especially if it’s one you really want. However, keeping your cool is key to performing well. Here are a few tips to help you relax and present your best self:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a checklist of what you need to do and bring with you. This will help keep your mind calm and organized.</li>
<li>Practice and rehearse your responses to common interview questions. This will help you feel confident in your answers.</li>
<li>Get plenty of sleep the night before and drink plenty of water before the interview. This will help keep you feeling alert and energized.</li>
<li>Take a few deep breaths before the interview starts. This will help calm your nerves and focus your mind.</li>
<li>Smile and make eye contact with the interviewer. This will make them feel comfortable and put you at ease.<br> following these tips should help you stay calm and focused during your next job interview!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Pace-yourself"><a href="#Pace-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Pace yourself!"></a>Pace yourself!</h1><p>It’s easy to get caught up in the moment and push yourself too hard when you’re working out. Suddenly, instead of a leisurely jog, you’re running a 5K at full speed. While it’s great to be enthusiastic about your workout, it’s important to remember to pace yourself. Going too hard too soon can lead to injuries, and can also sap your energy for the rest of your workout.</p>
<p>So how do you find the right pace? One way is to start slowly and gradually increase your speed as you go. You can also use perceived exertion as a guide; if you’re working hard but still able to talk comfortably, you’re not working hard enough. Ultimately, it’s important to find a pace that feels challenging but manageable.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found your pace, try to stick with it throughout the entire workout. Pushing yourself too hard in the beginning will only wear you out by the end. And if you do need to slow down, don’t worry – just take a few deep breaths and get back on track.</p>
<p>Pacing yourself is especially important when you’re just starting out or returning from an injury. It can take time to build up your endurance, so don’t be disappointed if you can’t keep up with more experienced exercisers at first. With time and patience, you’ll be able to work up to their level.</p>
<p>In the meantime, focus on enjoying your workouts and taking things at your own pace. After all, fitness should be fun – not frustrating!</p>

From curries to savoury rice dishes, there’s nothing like a warm meal to keep you feeling comfortable in the heat. Not only do they taste great, but spicy foods can also help to cool you down thanks to their thermogenic effects.</p>
<h1 id="The-Science-of-Spicy-Foods"><a href="#The-Science-of-Spicy-Foods" class="headerlink" title="The Science of Spicy Foods"></a>The Science of Spicy Foods</h1><p>Spicy foods contain high levels of capsaicin, a compound that causes a burning sensation in the mouth. This compound triggers the body’s natural cooling mechanisms, which kick into gear when you eat something spicy.</p>
<p>The body releases sweat in response to capsaicin, and this sweat contains a high concentration of water and minerals like potassium and sodium. When this sweat evaporates, it cools the body down. In fact, eating spicy foods can raise your core temperature by up to 2 degrees Celsius!</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Spicy-Foods-for-Summer"><a href="#The-Best-Spicy-Foods-for-Summer" class="headerlink" title="The Best Spicy Foods for Summer"></a>The Best Spicy Foods for Summer</h1><p>There are plenty of delicious spicy foods that are perfect for summertime. Here are some of our favourites:</p>

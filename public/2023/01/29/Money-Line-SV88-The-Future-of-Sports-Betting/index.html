In 2015, the total amount of money gambled on sport reached $1 trillion and is estimated to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2020, according to a report by ResearchandMarkets.com. This growth is being driven, in part, by the increasing legalization of sports betting around the world.</p>
<p>The market for legal sports betting is currently estimated to be worth $60 billion, but is projected to grow to $205 billion by 2025, according to a report by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming. Much of this growth will come from new jurisdictions legalizing sports betting, including the United States.</p>
<p>The market potential in the United States is large and there are several states that are expected to legalize sports betting in the near future. Nevada has been the only state with legalized sports betting for many years, but that is starting to change.</p>
<p>Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada to offer legal sports betting when it launched its Sports Lottery in June 2018. The Delaware Lottery said that it generated $2 million in revenue from sports bets in its first month of operation. New Jersey followed suit later in 2018, when it launched its own regulated sports betting market.</p>
<p>Other states are also moving towards legalizing sports betting. In October 2018, Mississippi became the latest state to pass a bill legalizing sports gambling. The bill allows casinos in Mississippi to offersports betting on-site and online.</p>
<p>Several other states are also considering similar bills, including California, Illinois, and Michigan. If these states do legalize sports betting, it could significantly increase the size of the global sports betting market.</p>
<p>The global market for legal sports betting is projected to grow rapidly over the next decade, as more jurisdictions legalize this form of gambling. The potential for growth is especially large in the United States, where several states are expected to legalize sports betting in the near future.</p>
